# ðŸŽ® C++ Ultimate Tik-Tac-Toe Game

Most of us have played Tik-Tac-Toe Game as a child, it is simple, requires just a pen and paper and is easy to master. <br>

I decided to create the ultimate version of this simple game using C++ which can be played within the console. The ultimate version of this game is much more complex but is still easy to learn. <br>

If you would like to play my game you can download the file and run it in your favourite ide. This game can be played againts a computer or 2 player mode.
